This repository contains the work I completed during my data analysis internship at CognoRise InfoTech. 

The projects included analysis of three distinct datasets:

Cereal Dataset: I analyzed nutritional information and consumer preferences.

Employment Salary by Job Roles: I examined salary trends and distributions across different job roles.

Unemployment in India: I investigated unemployment rates and patterns in India over recent years.

Each of these project includes detailed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations to uncover insights and trends.
